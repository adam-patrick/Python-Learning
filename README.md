## Scientific Computing with Python

In the Scientific Computing with Python Certification, you'll learn Python fundamentals like variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. Then you'll quickly ramp up to complex data structures, networking, relational databases, and data visualization. [See the course here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python)

Below you will find the 5 major projects required for certification, which I have completed and linked here also.

### [Arithmatic_Arranger](https://github.com/adam-patrick/Scientific-Computing-With-Python/blob/PY4E/Arithmatic%20Arranger)

Create a function that receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side. The function should optionally take a second argument. When the second argument is set to True, the answers should be displayed.

### [Time Calculator](https://github.com/adam-patrick/Scientific-Computing-With-Python/blob/PY4E/Time%20Calculator)

Write a function named add_time that takes in two required parameters and one optional parameter:

a start time in the 12-hour clock format (ending in AM or PM)
a duration time that indicates the number of hours and minutes
(optional) a starting day of the week, case insensitive
The function should add the duration time to the start time and return the result.

If the result will be the next day, it should show (next day) after the time. If the result will be more than one day later, it should show (n days later) after the time, where "n" is the number of days later.

Case Examples:

### [Budget App](https://github.com/adam-patrick/Scientific-Computing-With-Python/blob/PY4E/Budget%20App)

Complete the Category class in budget.py. It should be able to instantiate objects based on different budget categories like food, clothing, and entertainment. When objects are created, they are passed in the name of the category. The class should have an instance variable called ledger that is a list. It also performs a variety of other tasks and outputs, including charts.
